                <h4>From Yen Press: A young priestess has formed her first adventuring party,
                    but almost immediately they find themselves in distress. It's the Goblin Slayer
                    who comes to their rescue--a man who's dedicated his life to the extermination
                    of all goblins, by any means necessary. And when rumors of his feats begin to circulate,
                    there's no telling who might come calling next... Adaptation of the Novel "Goblin Slayer"</h4>
